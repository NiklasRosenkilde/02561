      <h4>a) What is the difference between Phong shading and Phong lighting (the Phong reflection model)?</h4>

        <i>Phong shading</i>
        <br>
        A shading model is used for determining how the shading of an object should be calculated and how an object should be rendered. 
        For instance, the Phong shading model uses interpolation of the vertex normals to evaluate the color of every pixel individually, 
        resulting in a smooth looking shape even when using coarse geometry.
        This is different from e.g. flat shading, where the pixel color anywhere on a given face is the same. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Phong reflection model</i>
        <br>
        The Phong reflection model is a method for assessing the color of a given surface point, taking into account 
        the surface point, a viewer and a light source. The model is able to determine the reflected light (thus the color) 
        by assessing the interactions between the surface and the light source and supports ambient-, diffuse- and 
        specular lighting components.

            No interpolation. The color is the same for all pixels in a given polygon as the lighting is only evaluated 
            once for each polygon. Gives a clear distinction of the model geometry with sharply defined edges.</td>
            <td style="padding-top: 10px;">
            The method evaluates the lighting at the vertices by using the vertex normals for the lighting calculations. 
            The colors of each pixel in a polygon is then found by interpolation of the vertex colors. </td>

            All illumination calculations are carried out per-pixel by interpolation of normals from vertices.

      <h4>c) What is the difference between a directional light and a point light?</h4>
      A <i>directional light</i> may be compared to a vector, meaning that it has no direct position
      but is determined by a direction. As such, it emits parallel light throughout a given scene.
      A <i>point light</i>, on the other hand, has a specified position and emits light equally in all directions outwards from the point source.


      <h4>d) Does the eye position influence the shading of an object in any way?</h4>
      
      In the Phong illumination model, the calculation includes the vector spanning between each point and the viewer's eye.
      Changing the position of the eye will therefore affect the resulting reflected light and thus pixel colour. 


      <h4>e) What is the effect of setting the specular term to (0, 0, 0)?</h4>

      An rgb color of (0,0,0) corresponds to black, meaning that all light is absorbed and therefore no specular highlight 
      will be seen as no light is reflected.



      <h4>f) What is the effect of increasing the shininess exponent (Î±)?</h4>
      
      Increasing the shininess exponent 'concentrates' the reflected light, i.e. materials with very spread out highlights have a low shininess 
      exponent and increasing the exponent towards infinity creates a mirror effect.



      <h4>g) In what coordinate space did you compute the lighting?</h4>

      It was computed in eyecoordinate space.
